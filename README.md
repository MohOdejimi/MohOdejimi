### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a deep interest in AI. My primary stack revolves around Javascript and Typescript, employing React for the front-end and Express for the back-end. I find motivation in harnessing the power of technology to solve both individual and community challenges.

Currently expanding my skill set by diving into Golang, I'm focused on building scalable systems and backend applications.
